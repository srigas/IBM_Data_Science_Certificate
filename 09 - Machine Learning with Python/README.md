This course's Final Assignment involved a Classification problem. More specifically, four different algorithms (KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM) had to be implemented to train four separate models. Afterwards, each of these models had to be evaluated by means of the f1-score, the Jaccard index and the Log-Loss index (only for the logistic regression algorithm), by using a file of test data, which had to be pre-processed.
