The Certificate's final course consisted of a Data Science Capstone called **SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage Landing Prediction**. As written in the Capstone's notebooks:

> In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.

First, the corresponding data was collected using the SpaceX API ([Part 1 - Data Collection (SpaceX API)](https://github.com/srigas/IBM_Data_Science_Certificate/blob/main/10%20-%20Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/Part%201%20-%20Data%20Collection%20(SpaceX%20API).ipynb)), in addition to Web Scraping methods ([Part 2 - Data Collection (Web Scraping)](https://github.com/srigas/IBM_Data_Science_Certificate/blob/main/10%20-%20Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/Part%202%20-%20Data%20Collection%20(Web%20Scraping).ipynb)) and then perform necessary Data Wrangling procedures ([Part 3 - Data Wrangling](https://github.com/srigas/IBM_Data_Science_Certificate/blob/main/10%20-%20Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/Part%203%20-%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)). Having collected and prepared the data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed, both in terms of SQL queries using IBM's Db2 instance, as well as Data Visualization ([Part 5 - EDA with Data Visualization](https://github.com/srigas/IBM_Data_Science_Certificate/blob/main/10%20-%20Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/Part%205%20-%20EDA%20with%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb)). The Data Visualization process also involved the creation of interactive objects, namely Folium maps ([Part 6 - Folium Maps](https://github.com/srigas/IBM_Data_Science_Certificate/blob/main/10%20-%20Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/Part%206%20-%20Folium%20Maps.ipynb)) portraying the locations of the launch sites and their distance to specific points on the map, as well as a Dashboard ([Part 7 - Plotly Dashboard](https://github.com/srigas/IBM_Data_Science_Certificate/blob/main/10%20-%20Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/Part%207%20-%20Plotly%20Dashboard.py)) using Plotly. The final step was the deployment of a suitable classification model ([Part 8 - Machine Learning Prediction](https://github.com/srigas/IBM_Data_Science_Certificate/blob/main/10%20-%20Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/Part%207%20-%20Plotly%20Dashboard.py)), in order to predict the success rate of future successful landings. The deliverable for this project was a PowerPoint presentation, showcasing all of these methods as well as the results obtained.

Note: *All relevant datafiles can be downloaded from the links applied inside the Notebooks. For completeness, I've included them in a separate folder [here](https://github.com/srigas/IBM_Data_Science_Certificate/tree/main/10%20-%20Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/Data%20Files), so that anyone can use them to reproduce my results in the future.*
